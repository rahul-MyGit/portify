    career:
      "I started as a self-taught developer at the age of 20, while I was in 2nd year and it's been a rollercoaster ride since then. Am aka [kovachi](https://dub.sh/skidgod) on the internet. Won't you ask me what does it mean? [Click here to know](/about).",
    careerFull:
      "I began my journey as a self-taught developer at 14, during 8th grade, and it's been a rollercoaster ever since. Online, I'm known as [kovachi](https://dub.sh/skidgod), a name that reflects my roots—starting as an shell that is used for crafting.\n\nBack in 2019, I was just an average kid with little tech knowledge. When the pandemic hit, everything moved online, and I got a Poco F1 for attending classes. But, I quickly turned it into a gaming device, getting hooked on ***PUBG***. This led me to join Discord gaming servers, where I discovered the world of Discord bots.\n\nI met a guy named Priyanshu, the creator of the 'Groot' bot, and got inspired. I spent a year skidding code on Replit, eventually learning Python. I then built a successful wrote alorithms which is a modified version of Random Forest algorithm. Despite being boring for being a unskilled child, I embraced the name kovachi and started contributing to open-source projects.\n\nAnd that's how my career began.",
