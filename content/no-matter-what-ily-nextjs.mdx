# My Super30 Journey: From Discord Lurker to Harkirat’s Elite 💥

It's been a whirlwind of emotions, filled with moments that made me laugh, cry, and sometimes stare blankly at the screen at 3 a.m., wondering if recursion was slowly devouring my soul. But **Super30** is where I rediscovered why I fell in love with coding—and it's also where I learned to endure Harkirat’s merciless jokes. 😭

## First, What Even is S30? 🤔

The **Super30 journey** began when **Harkirat Singh**, our mentor at 100xDevs, **announced that he’d personally train just 30 students** from across the cohort. Now, 100xDevs itself is no joke—it's packed with *absolute legends* grinding 24/7, building full-stack apps, automating pipelines, and probably shipping their code faster than some people respond to WhatsApp messages. 

I had already completed **Cohort 2 (Full Stack + DevOps)** from **December 2023 to May 2024**, thinking, "Yeah, I’ve got this!" But then Harkirat launched **Cohort 3**, and I couldn’t resist diving back in to **revise every single concept**. August 2024 came with a surprise—**Harkirat decided to select 30 students for an intensive program.** Yup, that’s how Super30 was born.

The twist? He’d **personally interview everyone to hand-pick the students.** And when I got the call... bro, **I nearly screamed louder than a React app breaking in production.** 🎉

For me that moment was like **APP NOIDA AA RAHE HAI** hehe

## Getting the Golden Ticket 🎟️

The interview wasn’t some chill Zoom meet. It felt more like an interrogation—*Harkirat-style*.  
“Tell me about yourself.”  
"Show me your any MERN stack project."  
And the big one—“**What makes you think you deserve to be here?**”

Honestly, I thought I’d blown it with my nervous answers and one awkward joke about Kubernetes clusters. But **a week later, BOOM!**—an messae dropped into my inbox, congratulating me for making it into the ** Super30 batch.**

That moment was pure dopamine. I legit ran around the room like a kid who just found out their school announced a holiday. 🏃‍♂️💨

## What’s Life Like in Super30? 🌅  

*Forget sleep.* Forget weekends. **October 2024 hit, and we were instantly in grind mode.** 

Every day is like running a marathon with code, except your finish line is another bug to fix. Imagine:  
- **10 hours a day, coding and debugging** with the sharpest minds in the game.
- **Daily challenges**, late-night Zoom calls, and project standups where Harkirat randomly throws curveballs like, “What if we deploy this using Kubernetes instead?”
- Group chats filled with **memes, tears, and random ‘Ctrl + S’ celebrations.** (Yes, saving a file counts as an achievement at this point.) 😂

Some days I laugh so hard that my face hurts—usually because someone rage-pushed code straight to `main`. Other days, I sit in silent despair, staring at my IDE, praying that **CI/CD pipelines will magically work this time.**

And you know what? **I’m loving every moment of it.**

## Harkirat's 10-Hour Gauntlet 🔥

To say it’s intense would be an understatement. **10-hour days? That’s just the start.** We joke that **Harkirat's not teaching us coding—he’s building resilience.** 
- **Bug marathons** that last until dawn.  
- Harkirat’s random pop quizzes—*“What’s the time complexity of this? Wrong. Next.”*
- And the classic **“If your code works the first time, did you even write code?”** 😂  

There’s a beauty in this madness. We’re learning **not just to survive, but to thrive**—no matter how many merge conflicts the universe throws our way. **We build, we break, we debug, we repeat.** And somewhere between that loop, friendships form.

---

## The Emotional Rollercoaster 🎢

We laugh. We cry. We meme the hell out of our struggles. But **the real pain hit us hard** when Harkirat dropped the bombshell: *Super30 is only a 4-month program.* 😭 

FOUR MONTHS?! We were just getting started! **The countdown already feels like the final season of your favorite show.** Every passing day is a reminder that soon, this wild ride will come to an end.

The thought of **Super30 ending is like typing `rm -rf /` on your emotions.** We’ve bonded over code and chaos, built some incredible projects, and shared **the kind of jokes that only developers could find funny.**

## What Have I Learned? 🧠

Super30 isn’t just about coding. It’s **about becoming a better version of yourself.** Here’s what I’ve taken away so far:

- **How to build from scratch**: If something breaks? We rebuild it. If it works? We break it just to fix it again.  
- **How to iterate fast**: There’s no time to perfect anything. **Ship fast, fail fast, fix fast.**  
- **How to manage time**: Between coding marathons, debugging sessions, and 2 a.m. standups—**time management becomes a survival skill.**  
- **How to give and receive feedback**: Some of the best advice I’ve gotten came wrapped in brutal honesty.  

And most importantly? **I’ve learned how much fun coding can be when you’re doing it with the right people.**

## What's Next? 🚀

Super30 might only last 4 months, but the **memories and friendships will last a lifetime.** When the program ends, I’m **planning to launch my own project**—something built with all the sweat, tears, and joy I’ve poured into this experience.

But let’s be real. **Super30 isn’t over yet**, and I plan to make every second count. We’re still **pushing commits, breaking code, and cracking jokes**, and as long as that lasts, I’m going to savor every moment.

## The End? *Not Quite.* 🫶

I know that someday soon, Super30 will end. But **the things we’ve learned, the people we’ve met, and the fun we’ve had?** That’s not going away.

This experience is **more than just a cohort—it’s a family**. And just like any family, **we’ll stick together even after this wild ride ends.**

So here’s to **all the late-night coding sessions**, all the **merge conflicts**, all the **inside jokes**, and every **Harkirat curveball** that made us laugh and cry along the way.

Super30 isn’t just a program. **It’s a memory I’ll carry forever.**

And for now? I’m **cherishing every bug**, every Zoom call, and every “good morning” message that hits the chat at 2 a.m. Life’s too short not to enjoy every bit of this beautiful chaos.

**To Super30: No matter what happens—**  
*ILY, fam. 🫶 Keep coding, keep dreaming.*
